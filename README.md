<h1>Tembo Education challenge</h1>This challenge is quite straightforward. I need to build a dictionary pointing age to activities.<br><h2>Dictionary building<br></h2>The list given isn't a dictionary. So I have to do something. Essentially two choices:<br><ol><li>Create a dictionary and copy all activities over. This takes more space but logic structure is clear</li><li>Create a dictionary mapping age to index(s) of original list given. Saves space and allows easier insertion of new activities.</li></ol>In the end I chose 2.<br><h2>Output</h2>I just iterate through all parents and print activities based on age. <br>
